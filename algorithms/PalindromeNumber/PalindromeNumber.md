# [Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)

---

## Description

---

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.

Some hints:
Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1)

If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the restriction of using extra space.

You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the problem "Reverse Integer", you know that the reversed integer might overflow. How would you handle such case?

There is a more generic way of solving this problem.

回文数问题是非常经典的问题了，关于负数是否是回文数的问题，答案当然是不是，最小的回文数是0。

对于python来说只需要一行代码就可以解决，不需要考虑overflow的问题，这里再次体现出python的强大。
