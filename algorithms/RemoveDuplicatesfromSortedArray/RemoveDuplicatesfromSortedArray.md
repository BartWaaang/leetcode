# [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

---

## Description

---

Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.

For example,
Given input array nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

This one would be the first one writen in English. :)

This problem is a little tricky, because the description asks you to return the length of the array without changing the original array. This means you must delete the duplicates in the original array instead of creating a new array. Understand that, and it is not difficult.
